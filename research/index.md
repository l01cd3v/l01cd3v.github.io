## AWS blog post series

Starting February 2015, I started a series of blog posts about security in the
AWS Cloud. Each post is originally published on the iSEC Partners blog at
<a href="https://isecpartners.github.io"
target="_blank">https://isecpartners.github.io</a> and re-posted here. All
these posts are indexed in the [AWS Category
page]({{site.baseurl}}/categories/aws).
