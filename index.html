  <div class="entry">
    
      <p>A significant challenge for companies using the cloud lies in ensuring that
their firewall rules follow the principle of least privilege. It is
extremely common nowadays to delegate management of security groups to developers, for
both production and test environments. This means that security groups and
their associated rules are managed by a much larger number of employees than
what used to be the case in non-cloud environments, where a unique, smaller
team was in charge of managing all firewall rules. Due to the more dynamic
nature of cloud-based infrastructures, companies should review their cloud
environment&#39;s firewall rules on a more frequent basis than for non cloud-based
systems. Unfortunately, this is a difficult exercise due to the large number of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing">CIDRs</a> that may be whitelisted in a given AWS account. Keeping track of all
known CIDRs and what hosts or networks they represent is not easy for
employees, and is almost impossible for external auditors who must perform the
review within a limited timeframe.</p>

<p>In this post, I will document how this issue can be addressed using the
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes">AWS-Recipes</a> tools and
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/Scout2">Scout2</a>.</p>

<h3>Feed custom ip-ranges files to Scout2</h3>

<p>Today, I am excited to announce that Scout2 accepts JSON files that
contain known CIDRs along with arbitrary metadata such as the host or network
they represent. When provided with such files, Scout2&#39;s report displays the
&quot;friendly name&quot; of each known CIDR that is whitelisted in security group rules.
This means that, instead of reviewing a list of obscure IP ranges, users of
Scout2 may now rely on the name associated with each CIDR.</p>

<p>In order to use this new feature, Scout2 should be run with the following
arguments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">./Scout2.py --profile nccgroup --ip-ranges ip-ranges-nccgroup.json ip-ranges-ncc-offices.json --ip-ranges-key-name name
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the above command line, Scout2 receives two ip-ranges JSON files via the
&quot;--ip-ranges&quot; argument:</p>

<ul>
<li>ip-ranges-nccgroup.json, which contains the public IP addresses in the AWS IP space in use</li>
<li>ip-ranges-ncc-offices.json, which contains the public IP addresses of several offices</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore, the &quot;--ip-ranges-key-name&quot; argument indicates which JSON field to
display as the &quot;friendly name&quot;.</p>

<p>The following screenshot illustrates that, in the Scout2 report, the name of
each known CIDR is displayed. When an IP which belongs to a known CIDR is
whitelisted, the name of the corresponding CIDR is used. In this example,
5.5.5.42/32 belongs to the 5.5.5.0/24 CIDR, which is associated with the &quot;San
Francisco&quot; office. An &quot;Unknown CIDR&quot; value is displayed when an unknown value
is whitelisted.</p>

<p><img src="/images/aws/awsscout2-ec2-cidr-friendlyname.png" alt="Screenshot: Security group rules display the name of each known CIDRs"></p>

<p>The next section of this blog post documents how users can create and manage
these ip-ranges JSON files.</p>

<h3>Manage known CIDRs with aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py</h3>

<p>With AWS releasing their public IP address ranges, I decided to create a tool
that allows creation and management of arbitrary IP address ranges using the
same JSON format. The tool is released on GitHub at
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py">https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py</a>
and may be used in several scenarios:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automatically create ip-ranges files based on public IP addresses in AWS (Elastic IPs and EC2 instances)</li>
<li>Automatically create ip-ranges files based on IP addresses documented in a CSV file</li>
<li>Manually create and manage ip-ranges files</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these use cases is detailed in an example below, with detailed input,
commands, and output contents.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong> In the commands below, the &quot;--debug&quot; argument is used to
output pretty-printed JSON, for documentation purposes.</p>

<h4>Automatically create ip-ranges based on public IP addresses in an AWS account</h4>

<p>First, this tool may be used to create an ip-ranges file that contains an AWS
account&#39;s elastic IP addresses and EC2 instances&#39; public IP addresses. By doing
so, AWS users will be able to maintain a list of public IP addresses in the AWS
IP space that are associated with their resources. Assuming that AWS
credentials are configured under the &quot;nccgroup&quot; profile name, the command
below may be used:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py --profile nccgroup --debug

Fetching public IP information for the &#39;nccgroup&#39; environment...
...in us-east-1: EC2 instances
...in us-east-1: Elastic IP addresses
...in ap-northeast-1: EC2 instances
...in ap-northeast-1: Elastic IP addresses
...in eu-west-1: EC2 instances
...in eu-west-1: Elastic IP addresses
...in ap-southeast-1: EC2 instances
...in ap-southeast-1: Elastic IP addresses
...in ap-southeast-2: EC2 instances
...in ap-southeast-2: Elastic IP addresses
...in us-west-2: EC2 instances
...in us-west-2: Elastic IP addresses
...in us-west-1: EC2 instances
...in us-west-1: Elastic IP addresses
...in eu-central-1: EC2 instances
...in eu-central-1: Elastic IP addresses
...in sa-east-1: EC2 instances
...in sa-east-1: Elastic IP addresses
</code></pre></div>
<p>My test environment has one elastic IP address that is not associated
with an AWS resource, and one EC2 instance that has a non-elastic public IP.
Executing the above command results in the creation of an
&quot;ip-ranges-nccgroup.json&quot; file that has the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{
    &quot;createDate&quot;: &quot;2015-11-16-22-49-27&quot;,
    &quot;prefixes&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;instance_id&quot;: &quot;i-11223344&quot;,
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;1.1.1.1&quot;,
            &quot;is_elastic&quot;: false,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Test EC2 instance&quot;,
            &quot;region&quot;: &quot;us-west-2&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;instance_id&quot;: null,
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;2.2.2.2&quot;,
            &quot;is_elastic&quot;: true,
            &quot;name&quot;: null,
            &quot;region&quot;: &quot;us-west-2&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Automatically create ip-ranges from CSV files</h4>

<p>From experience, I know that many companies maintain a list of their
public IP addresses, along with other network configuration information, in alternate formats, such as CSV. In
order to help with the conversion, the tool supports reading CIDR information
from CSV files. The tool was designed to be flexible and allow the creation of IP
ranges from any CSV file. In this blog post, I provide two examples.</p>

<p>This first example demonstrates how to use the tool to build a JSON file based
on the CSV column headers. Only attributes specified on the command line will
be copied over.</p>

<p>Contents of test1.csv:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ip_prefix, discarded_value, name
4.4.4.0/24, ncc group, NY office
# This is a comment...
5.5.5.0/24, ncc group, Seattle office
</code></pre></div>
<p>Command line to convert the contents of the CSV file into JSON:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">./aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py --csv-ip-ranges test1.csv --attributes ip_prefix name --profile ncc-test1 --debug
</code></pre></div>
<p>Contents of ip-ranges-ncc-test1.json:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{
    &quot;createDate&quot;: &quot;2015-11-17-10-22-42&quot;,
    &quot;prefixes&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;4.4.4.0/24&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot; NY office&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;5.5.5.0/24&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot; Seattle office&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The second example demonstrates how to use the tool to parse a CSV file with
custom column names and separate columns for the base IP and subnet mask. The
&quot;--mappings&quot; argument determines how columns will be mapped to the JSON
file&#39;s attributes.</p>

<p>Contents of test2.csv</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Base IP, Dotted Subnet Mask, Subnet Mask, Something, Name, Something else
3.3.3.0, 255.255.255.0, /24, Value to discard, SF Office, Other value to discard
</code></pre></div>
<p>Command line to convert the contents of the CSV file into JSON:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">./aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py --csv-ip-ranges test2.csv --attributes ip_prefix mask name --mappings 0 2 4 --profile ncc-test2 --skip-first-line --debug
</code></pre></div>
<p>Contents of ip-ranges-ncc-test2.json</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{
    &quot;createDate&quot;: &quot;2015-11-17-10-07-22&quot;,
    &quot;prefixes&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;3.3.3.0/24&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot; SF Office&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Manually create and update ip-ranges</h4>

<p>In case CIDRs were not managed in a CSV file, the tools offers an interactive
mode that may be leveraged to manually create a JSON ip-ranges file. The
following snippet illustrates how to use the tool to interactively create new
ip-ranges JSON files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py --interactive --profile ncc-offices --attributes name

Add a new IP prefix to the ip ranges (y/n)? 
y
Enter the new IP prefix:
5.5.5.0/24
You entered &quot;5.5.5.0/24&quot;. Is that correct (y/n)? 
y
Enter the &#39;name&#39; value:
San Francisco
You entered &quot;San Francisco&quot;. Is that correct (y/n)? 
y
Add a new IP prefix to the ip ranges (y/n)? 
y
Enter the new IP prefix:
6.6.6.6/32
You entered &quot;6.6.6.6/32&quot;. Is that correct (y/n)? 
y
Enter the &#39;name&#39; value:
San Francisco
You entered &quot;San Francisco&quot;. Is that correct (y/n)? 
y
Add a new IP prefix to the ip ranges (y/n)? 
n
</code></pre></div>
<p>Contents of ip-ranges-ncc-offices.json:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{
    &quot;createDate&quot;: &quot;2015-11-16-22-44-38&quot;,
    &quot;prefixes&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;5.5.5.0/24&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;San Francisco&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;6.6.6.6/32&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;San Francisco&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The tool can also automatically add new CIDRs to existing ip-ranges files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_recipes_create_ip_ranges.py --interactive --profile ncc-offices --attributes name --debug

Loading existing IP ranges from ip-ranges-ncc-offices.json
Add a new IP prefix to the ip ranges (y/n)? 
y
Enter the new IP prefix:
7.7.7.7/32
You entered &quot;7.7.7.7/32&quot;. Is that correct (y/n)? 
y
Enter the &#39;name&#39; value:
Seattle
You entered &quot;Seattle&quot;. Is that correct (y/n)? 
y
Add a new IP prefix to the ip ranges (y/n)? 
n
File &#39;ip-ranges-ncc-offices.json&#39; already exists. Do you want to overwrite it (y/n)? 
y

$ cat ip-ranges-ncc-offices.json 
{
    &quot;createDate&quot;: &quot;2015-11-16-22-44-38&quot;,
    &quot;prefixes&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;5.5.5.0/24&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;San Francisco&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;6.6.6.6/32&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;San Francisco&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;ip_prefix&quot;: &quot;7.7.7.7/32&quot;,
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Seattle&quot;
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This addition to Scout2 provides AWS account administrators and auditors with
an improved insight into their environment. Usage of this feature should result
in further hardened security groups because detection of unknown whitelisted
CIDRs and understanding of existing rules is significantly easier.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a major rework of Scout2&#39;s reporting engine,
which will further improve reporting and allow creation of new alerts when an
unknown CIDR is whitelisted.</p>

  <div class="entry">
    
      <p>Today, I am excited to announce that support for Redshift was added in
Scout2. By default, Scout2 will fetch information about your Redshift clusters,
cluster parameter groups, and cluster security groups if you still use
EC2-Classic. At this stage, Scout2 comes with six Redshift security rules that
are enabled by default:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clusters

<ul>
<li>Check whether version upgrade is enabled</li>
<li>Check whether the cluster is publicly accessible</li>
<li>Check whether database encryption is enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cluster parameter groups

<ul>
<li>Check whether SSL/TLS is required to access the database</li>
<li>Check whether user activity logging is enabled</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cluster security groups (EC2-classic)

<ul>
<li>Check whether the security group allows access to all IP addresses (0.0.0.0/0)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Scout2 was first released over a year and a half ago, and proved to be extremely
helpful when performing AWS configuration reviews. While
Scout2&#39;s initial release only supported three services (IAM, EC2, and S3) and
included thirteen security checks, the tool rapidly grew to add support for RDS
and CloudTrail. Furthermore, the tool now offers over fifty tests throughout
these five supported services. I hope that support for Redshift will bring
value to users of Scout2, and welcome feature requests, bug reports, and
recommendations on Github at
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/Scout2/issues">https://github.com/iSECPartners/Scout2/issues</a>.</p>

</h6>

  

  

  <div class="entry">
    
      <p>With boto3 being stable and generally available<sup><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/06/boto3-aws-sdk-for-python-version-3-is-now-generally-available">1</a></sup>, I took the opportunity
to migrate Scout2 and AWS-recipes to boto3. As part of that migration
effort, I decided to publish the formerly-known-as AWSUtils repository -- used
by Scout2 and AWS-recipes -- as a python package required by these tools,
rather than requiring users to work with Git submodules. I&#39;ve also added more
flexibility when working with MFA-protected API calls and improved versioning
across the project.</p>

<h3>opinel</h3>

<p>To avoid name conflicts, I decided to rename the shared AWSUtils code to a
less misleading name: opinel. The opinel package is published on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opinel">PyPI</a>, and thus can
be installed using pip and easy_install. The corresponding source code is still
open-sourced on Github at <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/opinel">https://github.com/iSECPartners/opinel</a>.
As a result, Scout2 and AWS-recipes have been modified to list opinel as a
requirement, which significantly simplifies installation and management of this
shared code.</p>

<h3>Support for Python 2.7 and 3.x</h3>

<p>Because boto3 supports both Python2 and Python3, I decided to make sure that
the code built on top of that package has similar properties. As a result,
the latest versions of Scout2 and AWS-recipes support Python 2.7 and 3.x.
Note that opinel will <strong>NOT</strong> work with Python 2.6.</p>

<h3>Modification of the MFA workflow</h3>

<p>As requested by a user of AWS-recipes<sup><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/opinel/issues/4">2</a></sup>, I modified the workflow when
using MFA-protected API access to no longer store the long-lived credentials
in a separate file. As a result, the <em>.aws/credentials.no-mfa</em> file is no
longer supported and all credentials are stored in the standard AWS credentials
file under <em>.aws/credentials</em>. Usage of the existing tools remains unchanged,
but the long-lived credentials are now accessible via a new profile name:
<em>profile_name-nomfa</em>. This allows users to work with both STS and long-lived
credentials if need be.</p>

<p>If you already had configured your environment to work with MFA-protected API
access, you will need to copy your long-lived credentials back to the
<em>.aws/credentials</em> file. This can be done with a simple command such as the
following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cat ~/.aws/credentials.no-mfa | sed -e &#39;s/]$/-nomfa]/g&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.aws/credentials
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Support to use assumed-role credentials</h3>

<p>With this new workflow implemented, I created a new recipe that allows
configuration of role-credentials in the <em>.aws/credentials</em> file. When the following
command is run, it uses the credentials associated with the <em>isecpartners</em>
profile to request role credentials for the IAM-Scout2 role. The role
credentials are then written in the <em>.aws/credentials</em> file in a new profile
named <em>isecpartners-Scout2</em>, which is the profile name appended by the role
session name.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_recipes_assume_role.py --profile isecpartners --role-arn arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/IAM-Scout2 --role-session-name Scout2
</code></pre></div>
<p>Users can then use their favorite tools that support profiles. For example,
Scout2 could be run with the following command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./Scout2.py --profile isecpartners-Scout2
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this recipe supports MFA if the assumed role requires it:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you never configured your environment to work with MFA, you can provide your MFA serial number (ARN) and current token code as arguments.</li>
<li>If you already configured your environment to work with MFA and stored your MFA serial in the <em>.aws/credentials</em> file, you just need to pass your token code as an additional argument.</li>
<li>Finally, if you already initiated an STS session, you do not need to provide a new token code and can run the command as above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>With the release of opinel, I hope to simplify distribution and management of
the code shared between Scout2 and AWS-recipes. Additionally, I
significantly modified the workflow and credentials storage when working with
MFA-protected API calls, which allows users to use both their long-lived and STS
credentials.</p>

      <p>The previous <a href="/aws/2015/02/24/iam_user_management.html">IAM user management strategy</a> post discussed how
usage of IAM groups enables AWS administrators to consistently grant privileges
and enforce a number of security rules (such as MFA-protected API access). This
blog post will build on this idea by introducing category groups and
documenting new tools to improve IAM user management.</p>

<h3>Categorize your IAM users</h3>

<p>For a variety of reasons, applying a single set of security rules to all IAM
users is not always practical. For example, because many applications running
in AWS predate IAM roles, numerous environments still rely on the existence of
headless IAM users. Additionally, third parties may be granted access to an AWS
account for a number of reasons but may not be able to comply with the same set
of security rules that employees follow. For this reason, NCC recommends using
category groups to sort IAM users and reliably enforce appropriate security
measures. For example, one group for all human users and a second for all headless users may be
created: MFA-protected API access and password management are not relevant for
headless users. Furthermore, human users may be categorized into several groups
such as employees and contractors: API access can be restricted to the
corporate IP range for employees but might not be achievable for contractors.</p>

<p><em>Note 1:</em> The set of category groups should define all types of IAM users that
may exist in your AWS account and each IAM user should belong to one -- and
only one -- category group (they may belong to other groups though).</p>

<p><em>Note 2:</em> The common group and category groups should be used to enable enforcing
security in one&#39;s AWS environment. Policies attached to these groups should be
carefully reviewed and grant the minimum set of privileges necessary for this
type of IAM user (<em>e.g.</em> credential management for humans).</p>

<h3>Example of category groups</h3>

<p>The rest of this article describes a number of tools developed and used by
NCC to help implement this IAM user management strategy. These tools can be found
in the <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes">AWS-Recipes</a> repository. We will 
use our test AWS environment as an example, in which we use three category groups in
addition to the <em>AllUsers</em> common group:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>AllHumans</em>, the group all employees must belong to.</li>
<li><em>AllHeadlessUsers</em>, the group all headless IAM users must belong to.</li>
<li><em>AllMisconfiguredUsers</em>, a placeholder for sample misconfigured users.</li>
</ol>

<p>We also have an IAM user naming convention that requires usernames to match the
following schema:</p>

<ol>
<li>Employees: firstname initial appended with lastname</li>
<li>Headless user: name of the service prefixed with <em>HeadlessUser-</em></li>
<li>Misconfigured: description of the misconfiguration prefixed with <em>MisconfiguredUser-</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Based on these rules, we created a configuration file stored under
<em>.aws/recipes/isecpartners.json</em>, with <em>isecpartners</em> matching the profile&#39;s
name. If you do not use profiles, the configuration will be under
<em>.aws/recipes/default.json</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">{
    &quot;common_groups&quot;: [ &quot;AllUsers&quot; ],
    &quot;category_groups&quot;: [
        &quot;AllHumanUsers&quot;,
        &quot;AllHeadlessUsers&quot;,
        &quot;AllMisconfiguredUsers&quot;
    ],
    &quot;category_regex&quot;: [
        &quot;&quot;,
        &quot;^Headless-(.*)&quot;,
        &quot;^MisconfiguredUser-(.*)&quot;
    ],
    &quot;profile_name&quot;: [ &quot;isecpartners&quot; ]
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>This configuration file declares the name of the common IAM group and two lists
related to the categorization of IAM users:</p>

<ol>
<li>A list of category groups.</li>
<li>A list of regular expressions matching our naming convention.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note 1:</em> If you do not have a naming convention in place to distinguish the
type of user, remove the <em>category_regex</em> attribute from your configuration
file.</p>

<p><em>Note 2:</em> If a regular expression is only applicable to a subset of category
groups, you must ensure that both lists have the same length and use an empty
string for groups that cannot be automatically associated (see the
<em>AllHumanUsers</em> group in our example).</p>

<p><em>Note 3:</em> Use of a configuration file is not necessary as all values may be
passed as command line arguments. If a configuration file exists and a value is
passed as an argument, the value passed via the command line will be used.</p>

<h3>Create your default groups with <em><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_iam_create_default_groups.py">aws_iam_create_default_groups.py</a></em></h3>

<p>The purpose of this tool is to create IAM groups whose name matches the common
and category groups specified in the above configuration file. Running the
following command results in four new groups being created if they did not
already exist.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">./aws_iam_create_default_groups.py --profile isecpartners
</code></pre></div>
<h3>(Automatically) sort IAM users with <em><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_iam_sort_users.py">aws_iam_sort_users.py</a>.</em></h3>

<p>This tool iterates through all IAM users and attempts to automatically detect
the IAM groups each user should belong to. For convenience, we recommend adding
the following to your AWS recipes configuration files:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&quot;aws_sort_users.py&quot;: {
    &quot;create_groups&quot;: false,
},
&quot;force_common_group&quot;: true
</code></pre></div>
<p>This specifies default values for additional arguments to be set when running
<em>aws_iam_sort_users.py</em>. Specifically, with these values, running this tool
will automatically add all IAM users to the common group <em>AllUsers</em> and will
not attempt to create the default groups (not necessary as we already did
this). Additionally, this tool checks that each IAM user belongs to one of the
category groups. If this is not the case and the username matches a regular
expression, the user is automatically added to the matching category group. Otherwise, a
multi-choice prompt appears to allow manual selection of the appropriate
category group.</p>

<h3>Additional advantages of configuration files</h3>

<p>Besides helping with simplification of these tools&#39; usage, this new AWS-recipe
configuration file can be used across tools, allowing for more consistent
rule enforcement. For example, the
<em><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_iam_create_user.py">aws_iam_create_user.py</a>.</em>
tool uses this configuration file and applies the same business logic to add
users to the common group and appropriate category group at user creation time. In
our test environment, for example, running the following command automatically
added the new user to the <em>MisconfiguredUser</em> group:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_iam_create_user.py --profile isecpartners --users MisconfiguredUser-BlogPostExample
Creating user MisconfiguredUser-BlogPostExample...
Save unencrypted value (y/n)? y
User &#39;MisconfiguredUser-BlogPostExample&#39; does not belong to the mandatory common group &#39;AllUsers&#39;. Do you want to remediate this now (y/n)? y
User &#39;MisconfiguredUser-BlogPostExample&#39; does not belong to any of the category group (AllHumanUsers, AllHeadlessUsers, AllMisconfiguredUsers). Automatically adding...
Enabling MFA for user MisconfiguredUser-BlogPostExample...
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>While efficient and reliable management of IAM users can be challenging, using
the right strategy and tools significantly simplifies this process. Creation
and use of a naming convention for IAM users enables
automated user management and enforcement of security rules.</p>

      <h3>AWS Security Token Service</h3>

<p>The AWS Security Token Service (STS) is the gateway used to create sessions
when MFA-protected API access is enabled. This service allows IAM users to
retrieve short-lived credentials (<em>i.e</em> access key ID, secret access key, and
session token) in exchange for their long-lived credentials (<em>i.e.</em> AWS access
key ID and secret key) and their current authentication code. When enforcing
MFA-protected API access, as recommended in the previous <a href="/aws/2015/04/02/use_and_enforce_mfa.html">Use and enforce
Multi-Factor
Authentication</a> post,
IAM users must use these short-lived credentials to access other AWS services.</p>

<h3>Challenges with MFA-protected API access</h3>

<p>When MFA-protected API access is enforced, managing AWS access keys becomes
challenging because configuration files that contain these credentials must be
updated regularly. Users must also ensure that they do not lose their
long-lived credentials when modifying the configuration files to write their
short-lived credentials. In order to help with this workflow, iSEC wrote and
released several simple tools in the
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes">AWS-recipes</a> repository.</p>

<p>The collection of tools that we will discussed below uses the &quot;<a
target="_blank"
href="https://blogs.aws.amazon.com/security/post/Tx3D6U6WSFGOK2H/A-New-and-Standardized-Way-to-Manage-Credentials-in-the-AWS-SDKs">new
and standardized way to manage credentials in the AWS SDKs</a>&quot;, meaning that
SDKs are expecting to read credentials from the <em>.aws/credentials</em> file under
the user&#39;s home or  profile directory.</p>

<h3>aws_recipes_configure_iam.py</h3>

<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_recipes_configure_iam.py">aws_recipes_configure_iam.py</a>
tool allows users to configure and store their long-lived credentials in a new,
non-standard, <em>.aws/credentials.no-mfa</em> file. In addition to prompting for the
AWS access key ID and secret key, this tool also prompts for the MFA device
serial number because this information must be provided when making calls to
the STS API. Similar to the AWS CLI and SDKs, it supports profile names. The
following code snippet is an example of calling this tool to configure a new
profile called <em>isecpartners</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_recipes_configure_iam.py --profile isecpartners
AWS Access Key ID: AWS_KEY_ID
AWS Secret Access Key: AWS_SECRET_KEY
AWS MFA serial: arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:mfa/USER_NAME
</code></pre></div>
<p>When looking at the <em>.aws</em> folder, we can see that a <em>credentials.no-mfa</em> file
exists and that it contains the credentials that were just entered:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ls -l ~/.aws
total 4
-rw-r--r-- 1 loic loic 93 Apr  3 14:00 credentials.no-mfa
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials.no-mfa
[isecpartners]
aws_access_key_id = AWS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = AWS_SECRET_KEY
aws_mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:mfa/USER_NAME
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that long-lived credentials are configured, we can use the next tool to
call the AWS STS API and request short-lived credentials that will be used
to access other AWS services.</p>

<h3>aws_recipes_init_sts_session.py</h3>

<p>The
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_recipes_init_sts_session.py">aws_recipes_init_sts_session.py</a>
tool reads long-lived credentials configured in the .aws/credentials.no-mfa
file, prompts users for their MFA code, and retrieves STS credentials (AWS
access key ID, AWS secret key, and session token). The short-lived credentials
are then saved under the standardized <em>.aws/credentials</em> file to be accessible
to the AWS CLI and other tools built with the AWS SDKs. The following code
snippet demonstrates calling this tool to request an STS session token:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_recipes_init_sts_session.py --profile isecpartners
Enter your MFA code: 123456
Successfully configured the session token for profile &#39;isecpartners&#39;.
</code></pre></div>
<p>When looking at the <em>.aws</em> folder, we can see that a standard <em>credentials</em>
file now exists as well and that it contains the short-lived credentials:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ls -l ~/.aws
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 loic loic 576 Apr  3 14:14 credentials
-rw-r--r-- 1 loic loic 179 Apr  3 14:00 credentials.no-mfa
$ cat ~/.aws/credentials
[isecpartners]
aws_access_key_id = STS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = STS_SECRET_KEY
aws_mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:mfa/USER_NAME
aws_session_token = AWS//////////SESSION_TOKEN
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that the short-lived credentials are configured, we can use the AWS CLI or
other tools built with the AWS SDKs that read credentials from this standard
location. When the STS session expires, users just need to re-run the
<a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes/blob/master/Python/aws_recipes_init_sts_session.py">aws_recipes_init_sts_session.py</a>
tool and the standard <em>credentials</em> file will be updated with new valid
short-lived credentials.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>By using this pair of tools to manage their AWS access keys, IAM users can
easily use the AWS CLI and other tools built with various AWS SDKs in
environments that have been secured and enforce MFA-protected API access.</p>
