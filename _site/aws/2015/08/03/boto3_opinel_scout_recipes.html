  <div class="entry">
    
      <p>With boto3 being stable and generally available<sup><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/06/boto3-aws-sdk-for-python-version-3-is-now-generally-available">1</a></sup>, I took the opportunity
to migrate Scout2 and AWS-recipes to boto3. As part of that migration
effort, I decided to publish the formerly-known-as AWSUtils repository -- used
by Scout2 and AWS-recipes -- as a python package required by these tools,
rather than requiring users to work with Git submodules. I&#39;ve also added more
flexibility when working with MFA-protected API calls and improved versioning
across the project.</p>

<h3>opinel</h3>

<p>To avoid name conflicts, I decided to rename the shared AWSUtils code to a
less misleading name: opinel. The opinel package is published on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opinel">PyPI</a>, and thus can
be installed using pip and easy_install. The corresponding source code is still
open-sourced on Github at <a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/opinel">https://github.com/iSECPartners/opinel</a>.
As a result, Scout2 and AWS-recipes have been modified to list opinel as a
requirement, which significantly simplifies installation and management of this
shared code.</p>

<h3>Support for Python 2.7 and 3.x</h3>

<p>Because boto3 supports both Python2 and Python3, I decided to make sure that
the code built on top of that package has similar properties. As a result,
the latest versions of Scout2 and AWS-recipes support Python 2.7 and 3.x.
Note that opinel will <strong>NOT</strong> work with Python 2.6.</p>

<h3>Modification of the MFA workflow</h3>

<p>As requested by a user of AWS-recipes<sup><a href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/opinel/issues/4">2</a></sup>, I modified the workflow when
using MFA-protected API access to no longer store the long-lived credentials
in a separate file. As a result, the <em>.aws/credentials.no-mfa</em> file is no
longer supported and all credentials are stored in the standard AWS credentials
file under <em>.aws/credentials</em>. Usage of the existing tools remains unchanged,
but the long-lived credentials are now accessible via a new profile name:
<em>profile_name-nomfa</em>. This allows users to work with both STS and long-lived
credentials if need be.</p>

<p>If you already had configured your environment to work with MFA-protected API
access, you will need to copy your long-lived credentials back to the
<em>.aws/credentials</em> file. This can be done with a simple command such as the
following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">cat ~/.aws/credentials.no-mfa | sed -e &#39;s/]$/-nomfa]/g&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.aws/credentials
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Support to use assumed-role credentials</h3>

<p>With this new workflow implemented, I created a new recipe that allows
configuration of role-credentials in the <em>.aws/credentials</em> file. When the following
command is run, it uses the credentials associated with the <em>isecpartners</em>
profile to request role credentials for the IAM-Scout2 role. The role
credentials are then written in the <em>.aws/credentials</em> file in a new profile
named <em>isecpartners-Scout2</em>, which is the profile name appended by the role
session name.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./aws_recipes_assume_role.py --profile isecpartners --role-arn arn:aws:iam::AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:role/IAM-Scout2 --role-session-name Scout2
</code></pre></div>
<p>Users can then use their favorite tools that support profiles. For example,
Scout2 could be run with the following command line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">$ ./Scout2.py --profile isecpartners-Scout2
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that this recipe supports MFA if the assumed role requires it:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you never configured your environment to work with MFA, you can provide your MFA serial number (ARN) and current token code as arguments.</li>
<li>If you already configured your environment to work with MFA and stored your MFA serial in the <em>.aws/credentials</em> file, you just need to pass your token code as an additional argument.</li>
<li>Finally, if you already initiated an STS session, you do not need to provide a new token code and can run the command as above.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>With the release of opinel, I hope to simplify distribution and management of
the code shared between Scout2 and AWS-recipes. Additionally, I
significantly modified the workflow and credentials storage when working with
MFA-protected API calls, which allows users to use both their long-lived and STS
credentials.</p>
