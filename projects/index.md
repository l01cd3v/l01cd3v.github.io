## Cloud Security

### AWS Scout2

Scout2 is a security tool designed to assist security assessments of AWS
environments. It is written in Python and uses boto (AWS SDK for Python) to
gather security-related information for several services such as IAM, EC2, and
S3. The tool is open-source and available on Github at
[https://github.com/iSECPartners/Scout2](https://github.com/iSECPartners/Scout2).

## Privacy

### CookieJar

CookieJar is a browser extension for Chrome and Opera that strips cookies out
of HTTP requests when the root domain of the target URL does not match the root
domain of the tab's URL. It has the effect of anonymizing all "silent" requests
that are sent to third parties (_e.g._ social networks) when you browse the
web. The source code is open-source and available on Github at
[https://github.com/l01cd3v/CookieJar](https://github.com/l01cd3v/CookieJar).
The released extensions are available for free in each browser's extension
store:
