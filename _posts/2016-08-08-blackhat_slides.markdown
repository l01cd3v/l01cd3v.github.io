Last Tuesday (August 3rd), I presented "Access Keys Will Kill You Before You
Kill The Password" at Black Hat US 2016. The summary is on the <a

href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-16/briefings.html#access-keys-will-kill-you-before-you-kill-the-password">Black
Hat website</a> and the updated slide deck is available <a
href="slides/us-16-Simon-Access-Keys-Will-Kill-You-Before-You-Kill-The-Password.pdf">Here</a>.
This presentation aimed at highlighting risks associated with usage of AWS API
access keys in environments that do not enforce MFA-protected API access, and
documented strategies and IAM policies to help address these risks.

On Wednesday (August 4th), I presented Scout2 at Black Hat Arsenal. During two
hours, I had the opportunity to demo Scout2 and meet users of the tool who
shared valuable feedback with me. I look forward to implementing some of the
features discussed during this event, including adding support for ECS and
finishing the new rules generator.

As a reminder, Scout2 is available on <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/nccgroup/Scout2">Github</a>, feedback is appreciated,
and feature requests and pull requests are welcome. The Scout2 documentation is
available at <a target="_blank"
