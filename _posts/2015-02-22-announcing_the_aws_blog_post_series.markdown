Starting this month, iSEC Partners will start a series of blog posts related to
AWS. The goal of these blog posts will be to:

* Discuss common security gaps in AWS environments
* Discuss common security gaps in the architecture of applications deployed in
  the cloud
* Describe methods and tools used to identify these security gaps
* Share tools and scripts that facilitate daily and secure work with AWS
* Share AWS policies that help improve the security posture of AWS environments

To share material, iSEC created a new public
<a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/iSECPartners/AWS-recipes">AWS-recipes</a> repository
on Github. The tools and policies shared in this repository will be discussed
and explained in dedicated blog articles.

Because iSEC has been assessing the security of AWS environment for several
years, we have a number of ideas and articles in the pipe awaiting to be
written and published. Our target goal is to publish at least on a bi-monthly
basis at the beginning of the project, and adjust this publication rate after
we catch up.

Without further due, we will start this series with articles that discuss
Identity and Access Management (IAM) common issues and best practices, and will
present a strategy to improve one's security posture when using AWS.
